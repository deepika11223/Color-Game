# 🎨 Color Game  

A simple and fun **Color Recognition Game** built using **Python (Tkinter GUI)**.  
The challenge is to **type the color of the text, not the word itself** — sounds easy, but it’s trickier than it looks!  

---

## 🚀 How to Play  
1. Run the game.  
2. You will see a word on the screen (e.g., **"Red"**), but its text color may differ (e.g., shown in **Blue**).  
3. **Your task:** Type the **color of the text**, not the word written.  
   - Example: If the word is `"Red"` but shown in **Blue**, the correct answer is **blue**.  
4. Press **Enter** to submit your answer.  
5. You score +1 for every correct answer.  
6. The game runs for **30 seconds** ⏳.
